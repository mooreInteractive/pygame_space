This is my first time using Python, and I like making games, so I’m also learning the pygame engine. So far it’s been so fun and things are moving so fast that I decided to make a repo for it. 

This could end up being anything.

--space.py—

def
  -detectCollisions
  -wave

--classes--
  -Ship.py
  -Enemy.py
  -Bullet.py
  -Messages.py
  -Hull.py
