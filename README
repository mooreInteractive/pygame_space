This is my first time using Python, and I like making games, so I’m also learning the pygame engine. So far it’s been so fun and things are moving so fast that I decided to make a repo for it. 

This could end up being anything. I will start converting to an exe soon with py2exe, or pyinstaller, whichever is easier for rapid prototyping.

  -Ship.py

Game Controls:
  -S = Speed Adjust (Currently switched between 2, 4, and 8)
  -F = Firing Rate Adjust (Currently switched between 2, 4, and 10)
  -SPACE = Fire ze bullets!
