This is my first time using Python, and I like making games, so I’m also learning the pygame engine. So far it’s been so fun and things are moving so fast that I decided to make a repo for it. 

This could end up being anything.

so far just the one file:

--space.py—
classes
  -Ship
  -Enemy
  -Bullet
  -Messages
  -Hull

def
  -detectCollisions
  -wave
