This is my first time using Python, and I like making games, so I’m also learning the pygame engine. So far it’s been so fun and things are moving so fast that I decided to make a repo for it. 

This could end up being anything. I will start converting to an exe soon with py2exe, or pyinstaller, whichever is easier for rapid prototyping.

Main File: Space.py
  -def detectCollisions
  -def wave
  -def initGame
  -def getUserInput
  -def updateGameObjects
  -def drawScreen
  REQUIRES: pygame
  
Classes:
  -Ship.py
  -Enemy.py
  -Bullet.py
  -Messages.py
  -Hull.py
  -Bg.py


Game Controls:
  -S = Speed Adjust (Currently switched between 2, 4, and 8)
  -F = Firing Rate Adjust (Currently switched between 2, 4, and 10)
  -SPACE = Fire ze bullets!
  
  
Features(current):
  -destructible armor/gun modules
  -3 enemy types

Features(planned):
  -ship hull connection network
  -player hull placement
  -boss with lots of armor/guns
